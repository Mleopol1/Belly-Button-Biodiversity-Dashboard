This repository uses javascript to create an interactive HTML page which explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. A dropdown allows you to select various test subjects and view their results from the study. This includes their demographic information, top 10 microbes found in their sample, and a bubble chart of all of the microbes found in their sample.
