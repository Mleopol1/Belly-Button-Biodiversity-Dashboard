# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Project Explanation

This is an interactive dashboard built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard includes the following features:

    * A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in a selected individual.
    * A bubble chart that displays each sample.
    * Display of sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
    * Automatic update of all the plots when a new sample is selected.

## Getting Started

To get started with this dashboard, you can visit the live version hosted on GitHub Pages [here](https://mleopol1.github.io/belly-button-challenge/ "here")

## Built With

This dashboard was built using the following tools and libraries:

    * D3.js - a JavaScript library for creating data-driven documents
    * Plotly.js - a JavaScript library for creating interactive charts and graphs
    * Bootstrap - a popular CSS framework for creating responsive web design
